# RyPass
some password generation utility I made for practicing Python
When main.py is executed, a folder called `gen_passwords` will be created if doesn't exist and will include all password instances

# IMPORTANT!
please cd into src and run `main.py` from there so unexpected things won't occur
<br>
<br>
`cd src` 
<br>
<br>
`python main.py`

# Usage
`python main.py`

# Demo
